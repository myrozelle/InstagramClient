# Instagram Client
CodePath Android Project 1

Time Spent: 10 hours total

User Stories:
- User can scroll through current popular photos from Instagram
- For each photo displayed, user can see the following details:
	- Graphic, Caption, Username relative timestamp, comment count, user profile image
- User can pull-to-refresh for popular stream with SwipeRefreshLayout
- Show latest 2 comments for each photo
- Display each photo with the same style and proportions as the real Instagram (see screens below)
- Display each user profile image using a RoundedImageView
- Display a nice default placeholder graphic for each image during loading (read more about Picasso)
- Improve the user interface through styling and coloring
- Allow user to view most recent comments (not all) for an image within a separate activity or dialog fragment

Questions
- What is the best way to ensure that images used as icons have the right size and good resolution and fit in with surrounding widgets?  I took me a while to make it look like in the walkthrough and was wondering if there's an easier way.
